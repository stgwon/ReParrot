# reParrot

reParrot is a web application which allows users to search for auto body shops in their local area and find prices for various auto repair services.

This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of appointment pages (Add, Update, Delete, Confirm) based on user's roles (Client, OrgAdmin, SysAdmin) connected with backend SQL procs. I also built React component which incorporated Google Map APIs to generate a list of auto services connected with backend SQL procs to provide related geological data.

● Created the necessary procedures in SQL utilizing joins, foreign keys and pagination.

● Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thoroughly tested with Postman.

● Designed components in React to maximize aesthetics and functionality.

● Utilized styling with CSS and Bootstrap.

● Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code.

● Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management.
